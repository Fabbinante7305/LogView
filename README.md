# LogView

For the past several years, I have developed a habit of keeping track of what happens each day. I love being able to look at the current date and knowing what I did on the same day but in a past year. I developed this to make the process easier for me (and for anyone interested in the same thing). There are several functionalities...

1.) Write out daily log

2.) Search for a specific date (if logged)

3.) Display the current date in past years (Ex. May 15 on 2020, 2019, and 2018)
